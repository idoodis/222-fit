      "No words are enough to express how thankful I am to have come across 222 Fit. I first came across 222 through Facebook. Coach Bri immediately caught my attention. Towards the end of last year (2023) I found myself in a place where I wanted more for myself. I remember wishing I had someone who could guide me and inspire me for more. At that time, it was only a thought and a wish. However, in mid 2024 as I was in a journey to get out of my comfort zone, I came across a 222 Fit event. I decided to attend and little did I know Bri and 222 Fit would be what my life needed. Bri has not only helped me with my fitness journey, but she has also been an inspiration to me. Every workout she reminds of us of the power, the strength, the love, resilience, determination that each and every one of us carry with in ourselves. 222 fit is a place that reminds us of and challenges us to discover what each of our hearts & minds carry, put it into action, so that it may be shown on the outside.",

      "I have been working with Bri since December of 2022. I hurt my back awhile ago lifting weights so getting back in the gym has always been difficult for me and I have got really out of shape. Bri has helped me get better with proper lifting form and ways to strengthen my back. She is compassionate and always brings a good energy to every work out. I was never big into working out but she pushes me to become better to a point to where I enjoy it all. I have noticed not only a difference in my physical strength but also mentally how much confidence Bri has given me in the gym and in life. She is also helping me with my nutrition and how to make a proper meal. I have a very hectic schedule, Bri goes above and beyond to work around it wether it is doing virtual workout or weekends. Bri has been such a blessing to my life I would recommend her and 222 Fit to anyone looking for guidance.",

      "I have been training with Bri for almost 3 years now, she is an amazing coach, always kind, pushes you to be better, she is knowledgeable and trains with purpose and with attention to what the client needs at the moment. Since we have been working together I have improved my mobility, core strength, overall strength, my form has been constantly getting better and I see all these changes in every session. The work is not meant to be easy but it is going to give you results if you are consistent and willing to step out of your comfort zone. I really love meeting with her and this is definitely one of the best decisions I have made for my health and fitness journey. Give yourself a chance to make things happen and Bri can help you get there.",
